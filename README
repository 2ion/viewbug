viewbug - CLI for reading Debian bug reports
============================================

This script downloads bug reports by number or package from
bugs.debian.org in MBOX format and displays the retrieved files
using any compatible MBOX reader, defaulting to mutt.

It uses the commands bash, wget, tr, grep, mutt and
apt-listbugs.

This project's homepage is at <https://github.com/2ion/viewbug>.

Usage
=====

      viewbugs.sh [OPTIONS] <BUGLIST>

      <BUGLIST> is a list of instances of the two options

          -n BUG#
          -p PKG[/version]

      which refer to a bug by number or to all bugs of a package
      respectively. BUG# has to be an integer. PKG is a package
      name, optionally refering to a specific package version.
      
      If the argument to either option is equal to @, we take
      the bug#/package name from the X11 primary selection instead.

  Options:

      -A ARG
          Add an extra argument ARG when calling apt-listbugs.
          May be specified multiple times.
          Refer to apt-listbugs(1) for more information.

      -c
          Combine all retrieved bug reports into a single MBOX file.

      -h   
          Print this short synopsis.
    
      -v  
          Print the version.

      -x COMMAND
          Use COMMAND as the MBOX reader. $FILE in COMMAND will
          be replaced with the path of the file to be displayed.
          Defaults to "mutt -f $FILE".

Examples
========

Get grave bugs for bash and zsh:

    $ viewbug -A'-s grave' -p bash -p zsh

Get grave bugs for fcitx-mozc in version 1.13.1651.102-2:

    $ viewbug -A'-s grave' -p fcitx-mozc/1.13.1651.102-2

Get bug number 71231 and bugs in the packages sed and tar:
  
    $ viewbug -n 71231 -p sed -p tar

Easy, right?
