    viewbugs.sh is a CLI for reading Debian bug reports.

    Usage:

        viewbugs.sh [OPTIONS] <BUGLIST>

        <BUGLIST> is a list of instances of the two options

            -n BUG#
            -p PKG[/version]

        which refer to a bug by number or to all bugs of a package
        respectively. BUG# has to be an integer. PKG is a package
        name, optionally refering to a specific package version.

    Options:

        -A ARG
            Add an extra argument ARG when calling apt-listbugs.
            May be specified multiple times.
            Refer to apt-listbugs(1) for more information.

        -k
            Keep the MBOX files with the retrieved bug reports.

        -x COMMAND
            Use COMMAND as the MBOX reader. $FILE in COMMAND will
            be replaced with the path of the file to be displayed.
            Defaults to "mutt -f $FILE".

        -o NAME-TEMPLATE
            Set the template used for the generation of the output
            MBOX files. If $BUGNO or $G_FILEKEY occur, they will
            expand to the current bug number and an integer, the
            value of which is unique for each instance.
            NAME-TEMPLATE **MUST** contain at least one instance of
            $G_FILEKEY, because it is used for globbing.
            Defaults to "$BUGNO-$G_FILEKEY.mbox".

        -c
            Combine all retrieved bug reports into a single MBOX file.
        
       -h   
            Print this short synopsis.
       -v  
            Print the version.
